## Write up for stack-up

My additional custom widget is Crypto Price Widget for top 10 market cap cryptocurrency and that including a simple price and 24 hour price changes. The data is updated dynamically every 3 seconds. I also included color red for decrease price and green for increase price compared to price from last fetch of data. The data source is from [Coincap API](https://docs.coincap.io/)

I think this widget is appropriate because i like the widget page to be live, dynamic, and informative while maintaining the priciple of simple single page web app. The crypto price is my choice because it's simple and text only data but can be rendered dynamicly. Overall with other element like calendar, clock, reminder, and timer. This widget make webpage is good for all in one background page to standby on browser without the need to open a lot of tabs for recieving the same kind of information.
